## Student Record Program

### Problem Statement

In this first assignment, you are going to create a menu driven student record program using Java.

A Student is identified by following properties:
+ Name
+ Roll Number
+ Class
+ DOB
+ Contact

We'll provide a list of details of some students in a CSV file. More details about CSV file [here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FComma-separated_values&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHWSYX8zsjtAFVXgFsxgCfiR9uyFQ).

Your program should read the Student details from the given file and  store it in appropriate data-types. There are lots of CSV readers for Java, one is [JavaCSV](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.csvreader.com%2Fjava_csv.php&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHvfFeqDPZ7bS2yNcRe5YtfJxiTyQ).

After reading the data, provide a menu for following queries:
1. Search Student
 + By _Name_
 + By _Roll Number_
2. Get All Students of a given _Class_
3. Get All Student Names which have _Roll Number_ in given range
4. Exit Program

Make sure that the input/output of your program is well formated. 
If you have any queries, you can ping the mentors or ask in group.
